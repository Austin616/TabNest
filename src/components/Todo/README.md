## Component Architecture

```
TodoList (Main Container)
â”œâ”€â”€ TodoHeader (Date navigation & view modes)
â”œâ”€â”€ TodoForm (Task creation with advanced options)
â”œâ”€â”€ TodoFilters (Optional filtering controls)
â””â”€â”€ TodoItem[] (Individual task components)
```

### Core Components

#### `TodoList`
The main container component that orchestrates all todo functionality:
- State management for todos, navigation, and filters
- Local storage persistence
- Notification management
- Smart filtering and sorting logic

#### `TodoHeader`
Date navigation and view mode controls:
- Previous/Next day or week navigation
- Toggle between Day and Week views
- Smart date formatting (shows "Today's Tasks" when appropriate)

#### `TodoForm`
Task creation with expandable advanced options:
- Simple text input for quick task addition
- Optional description, due date, and reminder fields
- Collapsible advanced options to keep UI clean

#### `TodoItem`
Individual task display with rich metadata:
- Checkbox for completion status
- Due date badges with color coding (overdue, today, future)
- Reminder indicators
- Hover actions for edit/delete
- Support for task descriptions and tags

#### `TodoFilters`
Optional filtering controls:
- Show/hide toggle to keep interface minimal
- Filter by All, Active, or Completed tasks
- Task count summaries

## Usage

```tsx
import { TodoList } from '../components/Todo'

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <TodoList />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Todo {
  id: string
  text: string
  description?: string
  completed: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  dueDate?: Date
  reminder?: Date
  tags?: string[]
}
```

## Key UX Decisions

### Minimal by Default
- Filters are hidden by default and only shown when requested
- Advanced task options are collapsible
- Clean, spacious layout prevents cognitive overload

### Smart Defaults
- New tasks default to no due date (flexible scheduling)
- "Today's Tasks" is the default view
- Tasks are auto-sorted by priority (active first, then by due date)

### Visual Hierarchy
- Active tasks are prominent and clearly visible
- Completed tasks are visually de-emphasized but still accessible
- Overdue tasks have subtle red highlighting
- Due dates are color-coded (red for overdue, yellow for today)

### Student-Focused Features
- Browser notifications for reminders (perfect for study sessions)
- Week view for planning assignments and projects
- Persistent storage so tasks survive browser restarts
- Mobile-friendly for on-the-go task management

## Future Expansion Points

The modular architecture supports easy addition of:
- Task categories/projects
- Recurring tasks
- Task templates
- Collaboration features
- Calendar integration
- Time tracking
- Progress analytics

## Styling

Uses Tailwind CSS with:
- Glassmorphism design language
- Consistent color scheme with existing app
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode support
