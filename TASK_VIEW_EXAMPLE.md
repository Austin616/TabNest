# FocusTab - Refined Task View Implementation

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

Your FocusTab Chrome extension now has a sophisticated, student-friendly task management system with the following improvements:

### **🎯 Key Features Implemented:**

#### **1. Smart Task Visibility Logic**
- **Completed tasks**: Only show on their actual due date (not in future days)
- **Active reminders**: Tasks appear during their reminder window even if due later
- **Date navigation**: Shows relevant tasks for each selected day
- **Clean organization**: Tasks grouped by urgency and status

#### **2. Visual Hierarchy & Design**

```jsx
// Example of the improved task organization:

📅 **Today's View** (March 15, 2024)
├── 🔴 **OVERDUE** (2)
│   ├── Submit Math Assignment (Due 2 days ago)
│   └── Read Chapter 5 (Due yesterday)
│
├── 🟠 **REMIND NOW!** (1) ●
│   └── 🔔 Study for Physics Test (Due tomorrow, 1-day reminder)
│
├── 🔵 **DUE TODAY** (3)
│   ├── Complete Lab Report
│   ├── Submit Essay Draft
│   └── Group Meeting at 3pm
│
└── 📝 **Recently Completed** (2/5)
    ├── ✅ Morning Workout
    └── ✅ Review Notes
```

#### **3. Color-Coded Priority System**
- **🔴 Red**: Overdue tasks (urgent attention needed)
- **🟠 Orange**: Active reminders (with pulsing indicator)
- **🔵 Blue**: Due today/selected date
- **⚪ Gray**: Upcoming tasks and completed items

#### **4. Reminder Highlighting**
- **Orange glow**: Tasks with active reminders
- **Bell icon (🔔)**: Visual reminder indicator
- **Pulsing dot**: Animated attention grabber
- **"Remind Now!" section**: Dedicated space for reminder tasks

### **🔧 Technical Implementation**

#### **Core Logic Functions:**

```typescript
// Smart task visibility
shouldShowTaskForDate(todo, targetDate) {
  // Completed tasks: only on due date
  if (todo.completed) {
    return checkDate === dueDate
  }
  
  // Active tasks: show during reminder window
  if (todo.reminderDays > 0) {
    return checkDate >= reminderStartDate && checkDate <= dueDate
  }
}

// Active reminder detection
isTaskReminderActive(todo, currentDate) {
  // True if in reminder window but not yet due
  return checkDate >= reminderStartDate && checkDate < dueDate
}
```

#### **Task Organization:**

```typescript
// Organized into logical groups
const groups = [
  { title: "Overdue", type: "overdue", color: "red" },
  { title: "Remind Now!", type: "reminder", color: "orange" },
  { title: "Due Today", type: "today", color: "blue" },
  { title: "Due Tomorrow", type: "upcoming", color: "gray" },
  { title: "Recently Completed", type: "completed", color: "gray" }
]
```

### **🎨 UI Components & Styling**

#### **Group Headers:**
```jsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <h3 className="text-orange-600 font-semibold uppercase">
      Remind Now!
    </h3>
    <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-orange-500 rounded-full animate-pulse" />
  </div>
  <span className="bg-orange-100 text-orange-600 px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
    3
  </span>
</div>
```

#### **Task Items:**
```jsx
<div className="bg-orange-50 border-orange-200 ring-2 ring-orange-200 rounded-lg">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3">
    <input type="checkbox" className="text-orange-500" />
    <span className="text-orange-700">
      🔔 Study for Physics Test
    </span>
    <span className="bg-orange-100 text-orange-700 px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
      Due tomorrow
    </span>
  </div>
</div>
```
